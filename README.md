## Deployment

- `yarn run start`: starts a server on [port 3000](localhost:3000) and watches files for changes, compiling them on the fly
- `yarn run build`: compiles all files to the `build/` directory but doesn't watch for changes or start a server
- `yarn run deploy-event`: pushes to the `gh-pages` branch of this repository and deploys the site to hacktj.org/202x
- `yarn run deploy-homepage`: pushes to the [hacktj.github.io repo](https://github.com/HackTJ/hacktj.github.io) and deploys the site to <https://hacktj.org>
- `yarn run deploy-all`: shortcut for both `yarn run deploy-event` and `yarn run deploy-homepage`

In the case that one of the endpoints (/2020 or /) doesn't work but the other does, immediately set up a hardcoded redirect in the nonfunctional repository to redirect to the correct site.

## Notes for next year

- click "Use this template" (next to the clone or download dropdown) and name the new repository `2021`, under the HackTJ organizationâ€”that way it will be displayed on our website at <https://hacktj.org/2021> while leaving the old website up at <https://hacktj.org/2020>
- all of the deploy commands involve running the `switch` script in this repository
  - if you notice that this script deletes the content of either [`public/index.html`](public/index.html) or [`src/App.js`](src/App.js), immediately quit the deploy script and restore the contents with `git` and retry the `yarn` script until it works
- the `deploy-event` script doesn't commit the source code to the repository's main branch, it only commits the built website
  - you should commit the source code to the `main` branch each time you deploy
    - before you commit to `main`, always make sure you run `yarn run switch-event`
      - if you need to, create a [pre-commit hook](https://git-scm.com/docs/githooks#_pre_commit) to automatically do this
- don't run `git pull` after `yarn run switch-homepage`
  - only pull when you're set up for the event repository
