          When registering you&#39;ll also have the option to upload a
          r&eacute;sum&eacute;, which would be given to certain sponsors looking
          to recruit hackers. You will also have a chance to submit your
          r&eacute;sum&eacute; after you register if you are not ready to upload
          it now.

          Please note that registering alone does not guarantee you will receive
          a ticket. Tickets decisions will be made based on a variety of factors
          including the date/time you register, so make sure to sign up quickly!
          Tickets decisions will be sent out on March 2.
